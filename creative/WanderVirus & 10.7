( WanderVirus still out there -- you probably upgraded incorrectly )

  Hopefully you have all now taken our advice and upgraded to 10.7.  However,
  it turns out that may not have been enough.  If you got a message saying
  "error: could not upgrade radish" you may still be vulnerable to the
  WanderVirus.

  Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done about this.
